# Task-related changes in aperiodic activity during visual working memory

## Overview

This repository contains the code to reproduce the statistical analyses and 
figures from the paper:

Task-related changes in aperiodic activity are related to visual working 
memory capacity independent of event-related potentials and alpha oscillations.

## Repository layout
- `code/` includes all of the code used to run the analyses and generate the figures. Note that dependency toolbox folders need to be included here.
- `data/` copy the data from the figshare link below to this folder. Additional data files are included in `/extras`.
- `figures/` figures generated by the code are stored here.
- `stats/` statistical outputs generated by the code are stored here.
- `main.m` a master script which runs all of the code required to reproduce the stats and figures from the paper.


## Dependencies
Analysis was run on MATLAB R2024b. Additional MATLAB toolboxes may be required.

Other toolboxes used include:
- [Fieldtrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) - 20250114
- [BrewerMap](https://github.com/DrosteEffect/BrewerMap/releases/tag/3.2.5) - 3.2.5
- [RainCloudPlots](https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots/releases/tag/v1.1) - 1.1

## To reproduce the analyses

### Step 1: download the code
Download the code using the `<> Code` button in the top right corner -> Download ZIP.
Unzip the folder into the desired location.

### Step 2: download the data
Download the data from:
[https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Aperiodic_activity_during_working_memory/29146721](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Aperiodic_activity_during_working_memory/29146721)

Copy the data into the `data/` folder.

### Step 3: add the correct paths
First, ensure the toolboxes listed in dependencies are included in the `code/` folder. Then check that the path to the code has been updated in the `code/aperiodic_memory_set_paths.m` script.

### Step 4: run the analyses
To run all of the analyses, make sure the MATLAB current folder is set to the folder including `main.m` and then run the `main.m` script.  

Alternatively, analysis scripts can be run individually from the `code/` folder.
Note that the `aperiodic_memory_set_paths.m` script needs to be run first.
